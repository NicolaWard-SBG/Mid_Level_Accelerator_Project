    As a private person
    I want my information secure
    So that only I have access to my personal data

    Scenario: View information when logged in
        Given I am a registered user
        When I login with correct credentials
        Then I should see my personal information

    Scenario: Cannot view information when logged out
        Given I am a logged-out user
        When I try to access my personal information
        Then I should not see my personal information

    Scenario: Access denied with incorrect credentials 
        Given I am a registered user
        When I log in with incorrect credentials
        Then access to personal information should be denied
        And I should see an error message for incorrect login
